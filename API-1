[:/Book API/:]

Every request your application sends to the Books API needs to identify your application to Google. 
There are two ways to identify your application: using an OAuth 2.0 token (which also authorizes the request) and/or using the application's API key. 
Here's how to determine which of those options to use.

If the request requires authorization (such as a request for an individual's private data), then the application must provide an OAuth 2.0 token with the request.
The application may also provide the API key, but it doesn't have to.

If the request doesn't require authorization (such as a request for public data), then the application must provide either the API key or an OAuth 2.0 token, 
or bothâ€”whatever option is most convenient for you.

When your application needs access to user data, it asks Google for a particular scope of access.
Google displays a consent screen to the user, asking them to authorize your application to request some of their data.

If the user approves,then Google gives your application a short-lived access token.
